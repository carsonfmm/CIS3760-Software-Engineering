Students present seminars on diverse categories of design as a means to develop a personal design ethos. The final submission includes a set of drawings, diagrams and images that represent a set of design principles allowing students to consciously take a position in the world as a designer.

The course focuses on concepts such as risk measures, Bayes theorem, and basic and multi-attribute utility theories. The course uses these concepts to build analytical decision-making models considering the randomness and/or risk-attitude of the decision-makers. Various forms of decision analysis techniques will be covered and typically include, expected utility maximization, the value of information analysis, one/two-way sensitivity analysis, and sequential Bayesian inference. Practical uses and limitations of the models and techniques will be illustrated. [Offered: S]",

As most of humanity now lives in cities, the technology of city living increasingly becomes the technology of human life itself. The purpose of this course is to examine the technology of civilized life, with the city itself as both a technological system and a scene of technological living. Topics explored include food, transport, cars, architecture, urban planning, public spaces, sanitation and health, civics and governance, sustainability, and information and communications technology.

However, there is a wide and potentially dangerous gap between research and development on the one hand and societal awareness of its impact on the other. This course is intended to help students gain a deeper appreciation for the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will do this through an investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies and society as genetics and the law, foods and the media, and soil remediation and the environment.

This course also compares geomorphic, ecologic, and social functioning of rivers in pre- and post-alteration systems. The major theme of this course is navigating the delicate balance between allowing rivers to flow naturally and maintain ecologic functionality while simultaneously maintaining the river's ability to provide services of use to humans. What does human alteration of river systems mean for the current and future state of river ecology, morphology, and hydrology? Can we find a way for rivers to provide functionality that satisfies the needs of both society and nature?
