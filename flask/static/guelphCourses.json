In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine texts of creative writing for the environmental science presented within, following up with reading scientific articles related to the subject matter. We will examine the role that creative writing (poetry, storytelling, essays and more) can play in creating inspiration, interest, and even rigour in scientific thinking and communication. By the end of the course, students will be able to interpret and appraise the capacity of the creative process to unfold scientific discoveries, apply techniques of creative writing, and explore the fundamentals of an environmental science topic.",

In addition to regular tuition fees, students are responsible for the cost of transportation to St. Andrews, and for charges levied by the Huntsman Marine Science Centre for room and board. These fees are paid to Student Finance and Awards of the University of Guelph. A department application form must be submitted for approval before course selection. The signature of the course coordinator is required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.
